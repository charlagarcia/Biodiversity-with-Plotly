# Bellybutton Biodiversity with Plotly
See my work here!: https://charlagarcia.github.io/Biodiversity-with-Plotly/

## Purpose
Roza wants to develop a protein that tastes like beef, and thinks she's found the solution - a bacteria that lives in peoples' bellybuttons.

To test, she collected samples from people all over the country.  Each person has been assigned an ID number, but are otherwise anonymous.

She wants us to build a dashboard that is accessible by her, her research participants, and fellow researchers, where participants can look up their own results by ID number.

## Overview
1. Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
2. Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
3. Parse data in JSON format.
4. Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
5. Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
6. Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
7. How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
8. Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Results
<b>We created an interactive page where participants and researchers can view specific data through charts via a dropdown menu.

<b>The title is clearly visible, with instructions for participants to select their ID number to view data.

### Each ID number has its own data and charts to visualize that data.
<b>A bar chart shows the top 10 bacterias present for each participant:

<b>A bubble chart shows what bacteria cultures are present in each sample:

<b>A gauge chart shows the number of times the participant scrubs their bellybutton every week:
